                The Bug Tracker Software Application is a reporting tool for submitting and tracking application issues. It consists of
                Projects and Tickets that apply to a specific application or area of an application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tickets are submitted by users to report an issue. Submitted tickets are reviewed by a Project Manager and assigned to a
                developer to be worked on. The developer will be notified when a new ticket has been assigned.
                They will investigate the issue by contacting the user to get any specifics necessary to replicate the problem. Once a solution has
                been determined, the necessary modifications will be made to the application. Any required testing will be performed to ensure
                that the issue does not reoccur.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the issue has been resolved, then the Project Manger will change the status of the ticket to Resolved.
