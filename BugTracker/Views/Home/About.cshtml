                <p> The Bug Tracker Software Application is a reporting tool for logging application issues. It consists of Projects which
                encompass all tickets that apply to a specific application or area of an application. </p>
                <p>Tickets are submitted by users to report one particular problem. Tickets are reviewed by a Project Manager and assigned to a 
                developer or team of developers to be worked on. The developer or team will be notified when a new ticket has been assigned. 
                They will investigate the issue by contacting the user to get any specifics necessary to replicate the problem. Once a solution has 
                been determined, the necessary modifications will be made to the application. Any required testing will be performed to ensure 
                that the issue does not reoccur.</p>
                <p> The user will be notified that changes have been made so that they can evaluate the solution and confirm the issue does not
                continue to exist. Once the user is satisfied that the problem is corrected, they will update the status of the ticket to 
                Submitter Approved. When this is done,, the Project Manager will be notified that the user has reviewed and approved the changes.
                The Project Manager will then change the status to PM Approved.</p>
